# Python-_-Audition

This is the python code is for neuroscientists aiming to investigate auditory response of neurons (particulalry cortical neusons) to randomly generated tones of various pitches.
The octave band, duration of the tone, and some other parameters may be selected to be modified.

In this code, 2 channels were created, one channel is the sound & the other is the trigger to be connected to the trigger input of your recording instrument.
You may need to initially install 'sounddevice'  (can be found in pypi.org).
