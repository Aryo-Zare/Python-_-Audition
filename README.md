# Python-_-Audition

This is the python code for neuroscientists aiming to investigate auditory response of neurons (particulalry cortical neusons) to randomly generated tones of various pitches.
A follow-up PSTH (not included in this code) can then evaluate the neuronal responses to individual frequencies. A tuning curve of the neuorn in relation to the responsive pitches can then be generated by the investigator.

The octave band, duration of the tone, and some other parameters may be selected to be modified.
In this code, 2 channels were created, one channel is the sound & the other is the trigger to be connected to the trigger input of your recording instrument.

You may need to initially install 'sounddevice'  (can be found in pypi.org).
