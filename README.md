# Python _ Auditory Project

## module.py
various modules and libraries used in this project.

## tuning_curve.py  
This is the python code for neuroscientists aiming to investigate auditory response of neurons (particulalry cortical neusons) to randomly generated tones of various pitches.
A follow-up PSTH or KDE (mu_fit_15.py) can then evaluate the neuronal responses to individual frequencies. A tuning curve of the neuorn in relation to the responsive pitches can then be generated by the investigator.

The octave band, duration of the tone, and some other parameters may be selected to be modified.
In this code, 2 channels were created, one channel is the sound & the other is the trigger to be connected to the trigger input of your recording instrument.

You may need to initially install 'sounddevice'  (can be found in pypi.org).


## automate_mix_psth_fit_nmz_10_re_sig_8.py 
This is for analysis of MUA in neuropixels for the 8-soi paradigm.
significance level of the response (statistically defined) is also mentioned.


## ssa_click
stimulation : 8-soi paradigm , (broad-band) clicks.

## ssa_tone
stimulation : 8-soi paradigm , pure tones.


##
lh_410 : low_high frequencies in a band : it's already randomized based on center frequency & band-width.
10 of them are broad-band noises.

r_410 is the random numbers. They are not needed anymore, since they are already incorporated in lh_410.
